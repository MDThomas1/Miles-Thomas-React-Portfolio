            <p>Hi there! My name is Miles Thomas and I'm a coder located in Melbourne, Australia. I recently began my coding journey through a coding bootcamp at Monash University as a way to learn a new skill. As I am also a musician by trade, I thrive in creative environments and love looking for opportunities to collaborate with new people. I believe that, no matter who you are or how experienced you are at a craft, there is always something new to be learnt from any situation. While I am young and new to the world of coding, I always seek out new ways to challenge myself and enhance my skills. I will always strive to provide for you the best quality product that I can.</p>
